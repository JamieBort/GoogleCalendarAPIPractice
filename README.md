# GoogleCalendarAPIPractice

## Goal
The purpose of this repo is to create a project that I can make api calls to my calendar.

Note: the client id and the client secret is located here:
../DevFiles/KeysTokens/GoogleCalendarKeyToken.txt

Note about branches:
The documentation gives [Quickstarts instructions](https://developers.google.com/calendar/overview#quickstarts) for accessing the api with different technologies. Some of the choices are:
1. JavaScript
2. Python
3. Java
4. Node
These four interest me. I have created (or will create) a branch for each of these to implement the api calls using each of those technologies.
Currently in Python Branch.
