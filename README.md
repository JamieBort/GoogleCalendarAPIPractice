# GoogleCalendarAPIPractice

## Goal
The purpose of this repo is to create a project that I can make api calls to my calendar.

Note: the client id and the client secret is located here:
../DevFiles/KeysTokens/GoogleCalendarKeyToken.txt

Note about branches:
The documentation gives [Quickstarts instructions](https://developers.google.com/calendar/overview#quickstarts) for accessing the api with different technologies. Some of the choices are:
1. [JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/js)
2. [Python](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python)
3. [Java](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/java)
4. [Node](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/nodejs)
These four interest me. I have created (or will create) a branch for each of these to implement the api calls using each of those technologies.
Currently in ______________ Branch.

## Status
Created the JavaScript and Python branches.
Didn't progress far with the Python branch/documentation.

## Next Steps
1. Should work on getting the JavaScript version to work before complicating matters by attempting to use Python, Java, Node, etc.
